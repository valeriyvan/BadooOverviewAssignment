At December of 2015 I was doing code test for iOS developer position at Badoo. 

Here's requrements:

And here's Badoo's decision:

Hi Valeriy, 

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider you for employment. Having reviewed your test unfortunately we have decided not to progress on this occasion. 

There were some gaps in the test in the following areas 
lack of architecture and OO approach
using C where OO could do
not correct names and mixture of domains in one instance

We are grateful for your interest in Badoo and wish you every success in your career search.
